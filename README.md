# DiscordBot WelcomeBotV5
 This is the fifth itteration of the bot. It added a class that allows users to add files from the media lists to a list of favorites that would play on entry to the voice channel.

 The idea behind this bot is to welcome users on a server to a voice channel. The media files used are custom made or can be pulled from other sources. As long as the file is in the folder path, it will be availible to the users.
